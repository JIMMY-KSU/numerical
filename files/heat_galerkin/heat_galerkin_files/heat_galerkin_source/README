heat_galerkin_files README

heat_galerkin_single: runs the heat_galerkin approximation using one file
		      and command line arguments. What quantity is calculated
		      can be specified by commenting out commented lines in
	              the main() routine

command line arguments are as follows:

python heat_galerkin_single.py <n> <denominator for dt> <tintervals>

if you want dt = 1/15.0 put 15 as the command line argument

heat_galerkin_gen: interface for calcuating the derivative/energy functions
	           for the Galerkin approximation to the heat equation

heat_galerkin:     generates the necessary coefficients for heat_galerkin_gen
