stokes_fosls_files README

stokes_fosls_gen: generates the algorithm; defaulted to use stokes_fosls_new

stokes_fosls_new: uses problem specific boundary conditions (were implemented
		  because we encountered a lot of issues with the more general
		  FOSLS problem boundary conditions)

stokes_fosls_org: general boundary condition code; contains commented out
		  sections from trial runs (this code shouldn't really be used
		  but I thought I would provide it)
